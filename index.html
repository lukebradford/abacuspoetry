        <h1>Abacu<span style="letter-spacing:0.0pt;">s</span></h1>
        <p>Luke Bradford</p>
        <br>
        <p class="justified">
            <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Abacus</span> is a collection of constrained
            poetry: each poem is governed by a different formal rule applied to its entire text. In
            some, the central constraint is obvious. In others, you might need to work to find it. I
            seek revenge on a world that is nowhere near as orderly as it ought to be.
