        <h1 align="center">Abacus</h1>
        <p>Abacus is a collection of constrained poetry: each poem is governed by a different
        formal rule applied to its entire text. In some, the central constraint is obvious. In
        others, you might need to work to find it. I seek revenge on a world that is nowhere near
        as orderly as it ought to be.</p>
